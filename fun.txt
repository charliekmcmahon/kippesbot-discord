Interspace revolutions the way you advertise your server, the advert above is another server like yours that is using our bot, with our bot we find the servers get from 10 to 50 members. The bot is very easy to set-up and requires no permissions so there is no way it can do anything to your server :), if you are not happy with the bot feel free to remove it immediately, thanks.
